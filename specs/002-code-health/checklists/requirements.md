# Specification Quality Checklist: Code Health Improvement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass initial validation.
- Spec covers 24 functional requirements mapped to 6 user stories.
- Exclusions are explicitly documented with rationale.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the code review
  document provides sufficient detail for all decisions.
- FR-021 (miss-tracking threshold) offers a choice but does not
  require clarification since either option is acceptable and the
  implementer can make the decision during planning.
