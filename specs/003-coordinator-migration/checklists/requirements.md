# Specification Quality Checklist: Coordinator Base Class Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before
proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation
  details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass initial validation.
- Spec covers 16 functional requirements mapped to 4 user stories.
- Exclusions are explicitly documented with rationale, clearly
  separating this migration from the broader god-class refactoring.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the code review
  document and spec 002's exclusion notes provide sufficient detail
  for all decisions.
- The spec intentionally uses "platform" language rather than naming
  specific Home Assistant classes to remain technology-agnostic.
